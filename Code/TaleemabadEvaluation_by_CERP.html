<h3><a href="#2summary-of-results-produced-by-taleemabad" id="2summary-of-results-produced-by-taleemabad">2.Summary of results produced by Taleemabad.</a></h3>
<h4><a href="#grades-1-3" id="grades-1-3"><em>Grades 1-3:</em></a></h4>
<p>50.7% of all Taleemabad students meet the criteria for all 3 subjects compared to 29.4% of control students at endline. This represents a difference of 0.46 standard deviations compared to the control group (1.58 LAYS).</p>
<p>During baseline, the difference between Taleemabad and control students is statistically insignificant from zero for English and Mathematics. For Urdu, however, the difference was -13.6% between Taleemabad and control.</p>
<p>At the endline, the difference between Taleemabad and control schools rises to 22.9% for English and 14.6% for Urdu (both significant at 5% level). For Mathematics, however, the difference is -2.9% (i.e. in favor of control schools, significant at 5% level).</p>
<h4><a href="#grades-4-5" id="grades-4-5"><em>Grades 4-5:</em></a></h4>
<p>7.2% of all Taleemabad students meet the criteria for all 3 subjects compared to 6.2% of control students at endline. This represents a difference of 0.05 standard deviations compared to the control group (0.4 LAYS).</p>
<p>During baseline, the difference between Taleemabad and control students is statistically insignificant from zero for English and Mathematics. For Urdu, however, the difference was -8.7% between Taleemabad and control, meaning that control schools were at a higher level than intervention schools.</p>
<p>At the endline, the difference between Taleemabad and control schools rises to 3.6% for English, 1.5% for Mathematics and 2.2% for Urdu (all significant at 5% level).</p>
<h4><a href="#melqo" id="melqo"><em>MELQO:</em></a></h4>
<p>At baseline, Taleemabad schools outperformed control schools by ~6 percent of overall score in pre-numeracy but lagged behind control schools in pre-literacy and motor skills by 0.35% and 1.58% respectively.</p>
<p>At the endline, the difference between Taleemabad and control schools reduced to ~4% in pre-numeracy whereas Taleemabad schools performed better than control schools in pre-literacy and motor skills by 1.6% and 3.4% respectively. These results are statistically significant at the 5% level.</p>
